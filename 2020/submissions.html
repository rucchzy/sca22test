We expect that these sessions will be approximately 30-minutes long, and will include both pre-submitted and live questions, as well as moderated discussion for approximately three-related papers</li>
                      <li>Before the Q&A for each paper, we will play a 3 minute video abstract in order to get the discussion started and remind the audience the main ideas, challenges and contributions as well as some highlights of the results</li>

                         Authors for each submission are asked to prepare a short 10 minute presentation including a live demo or video of their results, and brief explanation of their system. Due to the risk of technical issues preparing pre-recorded content as a back-up is also strongly recommended.

              <p align="justify"> This year SCA is inviting members of the animation community to submit short showcase works to be presented at SCA alongside the latest academic progress. A showcase submission consists of a 1-2 page description along with an image reel, video or demo to highlight the contribution. Each submission will be evaluated by an international committee of animation experts (from both industry and academia) and accepted submissions will be presented at SCA alongside other showcase submissions and state-of-the-art academic research. </p>
              <p align="justify"> Showcase presentations can take any form, from a slide-based talk to a live demo,  and will also appear in a summary of the proceedings of the conference. </p>
