                            <p align="justify">SCA is the premier forum for innovations in the software and technology of computer animation. It unites researchers and practitioners working on all aspects of time-based phenomena. Our focused, intimate gathering, with a single track program and emphasis on community interaction, makes SCA the best venue to exchange research results, get inspired, and set up collaborations. 
                            We invite work on a broad range of topics, including:</p>

                                        <li>Papers should be submitted electronically using the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sca2021">online system</a> given above.</li>
                                        <li>Paper submissions must be anonymous and include the unique paper ID that will be assigned upon creating a submission using the online system. The SCA paper program uses <b>double-blind reviewing</b>, so please remove all personal data, such as author names and affiliation from your submission! Please use your submission ID instead of author names.</li>
                                        <li>Format your paper according to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM proceedings template</a> (recommended options: acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous).</li>
                                        <li>PACMCGIT, the journal where SCA papers will be published, has a <b>strict two-cycle review process</b>. That means papers will not be included in the journal after conditional acceptance if they fail to incorporate the required changes.  They will still be presented at SCA.</li>
                                        <li>Papers should not have previously appeared in, or be currently submitted to, any other conference or journal.</li>
                                        <li>We recommend that papers be up to <b>15 pages</b>, excluding references, when formatted with the acmsmall option. This is not a hard limit, but reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers (size up to 200MB).</li>

Note however that as usual, a SCA poster does not preclude subsequent publication of a complete paper on the same topic by the same authors (however, a SCA poster by other authors is considered prior art and should be cited as such). </p>
                                    <p>We encourage any of the following types of poster submissions:</p>

                                    <p align="justify">We are also interesting in work done outside of SCA that would be of interest to the computer animation community.
